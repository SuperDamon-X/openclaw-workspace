# HEARTBEAT.md

Read this file when you receive a heartbeat poll. Follow it strictly. Do not infer or repeat old tasks from prior chats. If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.

## Periodic Checks

Rotate through these tasks 2-4 times per day during daytime hours (08:00-23:00):

- **Email** - Check for urgent unread messages
- **Calendar** - Check for upcoming events in next 24-48h
- **Notifications** - Check social mentions/notifications if configured
- **Memory** - Periodically review memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md and update MEMORY.md

## When to Reach Out

- Important email arrived
- Calendar event coming up (<2h)
- Something interesting/found relevant
- It's been >8h since last message

## When to Stay Quiet

- Late night (23:00-08:00) unless urgent
- Just checked in last 30 minutes
- Human appears busy
- Nothing new since last check

Track check times in memory/heartbeat-state.json to avoid duplicate checks.
